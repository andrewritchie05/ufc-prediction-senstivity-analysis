## 🎰 Betting outcome sensitivity analysis for UFC machine learning predicitions


Calculates and visualizes the distribution of potential returns, and the binomial probability mass function (PMF) for the outcome of bets, enabling effective risk management.

- Evaluates the monetary value of all possible outcomes, and weighs them based on their relative probability (probability that r out of n trials are successful).
- Uses a single value for probability of a correct prediction, so it is assumed that the ML classifier is well balanced.
- Assumes the total betting pool is spread evenly across each contest
