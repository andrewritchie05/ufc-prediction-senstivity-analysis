Betting outcome sensitivity analysis for UFC machine learning predicitions

ðŸŽ° Calculates and visualizes the binomial probability mass function for the outcome of predictions, enabling effective risk management.

- Evaluates the monetary value of all possible outcomes, and weighs them based on their relative probability (probability that r out of n trials are successful).
- Uses a single value for probability of a correct prediction, so it is assumed that the ML classifier is well balanced.
- Assumes the total betting pool is spread evenly across each contest
